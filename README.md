pyFlow - a lightweight parallel task engine
===========================================

pyFlow is a tool to manage tasks in the context of a task dependency
graph. It has some similarities to make. pyFlow is not a program â€“ it
is a python module, and workflows are defined using pyFlow by writing
regular python code with the pyFlow API
