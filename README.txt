pyflow -- a lightweight parallel task engine


This is the root of the pyflow development repository. Note this is not
the pyflow distribution tarball.

To create a release tarball corresponding to a specific version, run:

git clone XYZ pyflow
cd pyflow
git checkout VERSION
./scratch/make_release_tarball.bash
"""

documentation.
