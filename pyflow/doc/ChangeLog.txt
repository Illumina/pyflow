most likely)

interval.
v0.6.9
* Improve robustness against NFS update delay for task wrapper file
* Include more sge error details in Notification email 
v0.6.8 20120319
* Better handling on terminal hang-up: capture and ignore SIGHUP and 
handle failed writes to stderr. You should still use nohup where needed,
but if you don't, then proper logging and notification will continue.
* flush log writes
v0.6.7 20120316
* add tail of task stderr stream to nofications when tasks fail
* apply ctrl-C task shutdown to SIGTERM as well

logging to continue even after filehandles are exhausted in case it manages
to happen.
v0.6.3 20120305
* Switch sge mode from using qsub sync to a more scalable qsub-and-poll scheme
This immediately removes the 99 job sge limit, and provides the infrastructure
for queueing or running timeout on tasks.
v0.6.2
* allow commands to be submitted as argument lists (in addition to shell
strings, as before). Argument lists allow longer commands and obviate a
variety of quoting issues. 
* Change site configuration to an object scheme which simplifies site
customization.
* change qmake tasks from parallel env to dynamic allocation mode 
* allow qmake jobs to retry without an expiration window
* improved reporting of failed make jobs
* fixed minor issue with make path cleanup

* chuk pthread fix for pyflow tasks
v0.5.1 20120221
* Added autmatic chuk sge configuration to allow bagPipes to complete
in the uk.
* Various fixes from uk testing: (1) full hostname is correctly found in 
the uk now (2) default configuration for email is it now comes form 
"pyflow-bot@"YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME now. This is required to correctly
get mail sent from a uk box.
v0.5 20120220
* Cutting version of pyFlow to sync with first bagPipes prototype
* add max SGE jobs to configuration parameters -- default set to 96
* Fix sub-workflows to shutdown properly after task shutdown
* More robust handling of commands with quoting and special characters
* Non-breaking API change: isTaskComplete lets you query whether a task
is in the workflow and completed  -- useful for sane interupt/resume behavior
* Non-breaking API change: limitNCores(n) and limitMemMb(n) can be used now to
reduce your resource request to the maximum available for this run.

v0.4 20120216
* Added memory to the task resource tracking
* Created pyflowConfig file which contains site specific code --
moved resource to qsub argument translation functions into this
config file
* Non-breaking API change: Added isCmdStable option to addTask to specify that a command
can change on workflow resume.
* Non-breaking API change: all add*() methods return task label

v0.3 20120213
* Full support for recursive WorkflowRunner task specification -- provide any
other WorkflowRunner instance as a task in a workflow() definition.
