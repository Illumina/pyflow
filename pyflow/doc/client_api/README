Pre-generated client API documentation is here:

WorkflowRunner_API_html_doc

Full API documentation can be created as an html tree using the script:
'make_WorkflowRunner_API_html_doc.bash'

Note this requires the program 'epydoc'.

A simpler ascii documentation page can be generated in pydoc by running:
'make_WorkflowRunner_API_simple_doc.py'
